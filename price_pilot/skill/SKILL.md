# CN Shopping Compare

## Overview

Use this skill to turn a shopping request into a structured, cross-platform recommendation. Search live listings, normalize the evidence, score the options, and explain why the top choice wins.

## System Modules

Treat the workflow as four independent modules. Do not let an inquiry failure invalidate discovery, scoring, or decision output.

### 1. 商品发现

- Search platform listings or accept direct listing URLs.
- Extract title, price, condition, region, seller reputation, and publish time.
- Produce a comparable candidate list even if follow-up inquiry is unavailable.

### 2. 候选评分

- Score value for money.
- Score risk separately.
- Generate recommendation reasons from evidence, not only from price.

### 3. 询价助手

- Draft inquiry text first.
- Require human confirmation before sending.
- Track seller replies and structure quoted prices.

### 4. 汇总决策

- Merge discovery candidates and inquiry replies.
- Output ranked products, recommendation reasons, and direct product links.

## Workflow

### 1. Clarify the target

Extract the decision constraints before searching:

- product name and generation
- model or configuration
- new or used preference
- budget cap or target price band
- platform preference or exclusions
- risk tolerance
- must-have details such as color, storage, edition, invoice, warranty, shipping origin

Ask a follow-up only when the missing detail would materially change the recommendation. Otherwise proceed with reasonable defaults and state them.

### 2. Search each platform with live data

Use current web data for all time-sensitive facts. Do not rely on stale memory for prices, ratings, or availability.

If direct browsing is blocked, prefer these escalation paths in order:

1. Use a configured marketplace MCP server when available.
2. Use a configured local cookie export for the platform.
3. Ask the user for direct listing links or screenshots instead of stopping at "access denied".

Search these platforms unless the user narrows the scope:

- JD
- Taobao
- Pinduoduo
- Xianyu
- Zhuanzhuan

Read [platform-playbook.md](./references/platform-playbook.md) before searching.

### 3. Normalize candidate listings for 商品发现

Prefer 2 to 5 strong candidates per platform instead of dumping raw search noise.

Capture these fields whenever available:

- platform
- title
- current price
- landed price including shipping or coupons when visible
- condition
- store or seller type
- rating, review count, sales volume, or transaction count
- return policy and warranty
- authenticity or inspection signals
- advantages
- red flags
- listing URL

### 4. Evaluate evidence quality for 候选评分

Treat evidence quality as part of the recommendation:

- prefer complete specs, clear photos, detailed disclosures, and realistic review density
- penalize suspiciously low price, vague descriptions, mismatched specs, or repeated complaints
- for used marketplaces, treat seller credibility and inspection options as first-class inputs

Read [ranking-rubric.md](./references/ranking-rubric.md) before scoring.

### 5. Score and rank

Use `scripts/score_products.py` when the candidate set is large enough to benefit from consistent scoring.

```bash
python3 scripts/score_products.py --input candidates.json
```

Use the result as a structured aid, not as a blind final answer.

### 6. Use 询价助手 when deeper confirmation is needed

When the user wants true transaction-ready pricing instead of rough market comparison:

- draft an inquiry message
- ask for manual confirmation before sending
- track replies as quoted prices rather than replacing the candidate layer

### 7. Return a decision-oriented answer from 汇总决策

Always answer in a way that helps the user buy or reject:

- lead with the best overall option
- call out the best budget option if it differs
- call out the safest option if it differs
- explain why lower-ranked options lost
- mention the biggest risk to check before checkout
- always include direct product links when available
